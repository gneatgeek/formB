FormB is a class for common online form processing written in PHP. It offers support for user error handling, email address validation, web form validation, different ways to send data via email, html email template support, database user IP address logging, methods to sanitize user input to protect against XSS attacks, and more! This code has been tested to be PCI compliant as of 1-16-2012

If you intend to use this script, be sure to download a tagged version. HEAD is not tested for stability!

formB_config.php is REQUIRED by formB.php. Be sure to have it available or this system will not function!

If you prefer to use .inc instead of .php for include files,

Adding:

<FilesMatch "\.inc$">
	Order allow,deny
	Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

to your .htaccess file is recommended.
If a .inc file is requested, all of the code will be revealed as plain text (which is usually very undesirable).

See Default.sql for a proposed table structure for use with the IP-Checker methods!

A note, this script does a simple sanitization.  It is not sufficient for a CMS or the re-displaying of HTML submitted via a form.
